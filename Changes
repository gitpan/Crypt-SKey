Revision history for Perl extension Crypt::SKey.

0.06  Mon Feb 17 08:49:39 CST 2003

 - The README wasn't being included in the distribution because I'd
   removed it from the MANIFEST.  Now it's included.

0.05  Sun 15 Dec 02:02:22 GMT 2002

 - The tests weren't properly being skipped if their module
   prerequisites weren't installed, try as they might.  This has been
   fixed.

 - Added a mention of OPIE, the main system people might want MD5
   hashing for, to the docs.  Requested by Allen Chen.

 - The test 03-interactive.t shouldn't run anymore in non-interactive
   environments like CPANPLUS's smoke-tester.

 - Added a Build.PL so people can install via Module::Build.  This
   helps capture "recommended" dependencies like Term::ReadLine.
   (Note to self: it would be nice if Module::Build let you specify a
   reason *why* things are required/recommended, and if it let you
   specify boolean combinations like 'Digest::MD5 || Digest::MD4'.)

 - No code changes, just moved some tests from test.pl to t/
   subdirectory.

0.02  Sun May 12 11:06:44 AEST 2002

 - Implemented support for MD5 hashing.  Requested by Allen Chen,
   patched by Chris Nandor.

 - Term::ReadLine isn't strictly necessary now, it will only be loaded
   when using the key() function.
